Bug Fixes
------------------------------------------------
* Fixed ContentArg append bug
Since the ContentArg is placed in the event object you must copy that arg or 
the entire event object when announcing new events! This is expected behavior.

* Fixed redirect encoding bug
The redirect command did not URLEncodeFormat incoming event arguments.

* Fixed non-critical listener invoker mismatched argument name bug

* Fixed postProcess event name displayed in TracePlugin.cfc
PostProcess now reads "Core Process"

* Fixed strange "No Event-Handler Defined" exception bug
Mach-II threw an exception when the event name was "". If the event name is "", the
default event is announced as expected.

* Fixed framework loaded twice on initial startup bug
Framework loaded itself twice on inital startup when config mode is 1 (always)

* Fixed resultValue error bug
When a listener method returns void and the developer specified a ResultArg/Key, an 
exception of "The ResultValue variable is not defined." is thrown.  This occurs because 
ColdFusion deletes the var'ed ResultValue variable in the invoker if a listner method 
return a Java null or returns void.  A better error is now thrown instead of the useless
exception that ColdFusion was giving.

Improvements / Enhancements
------------------------------------------------
* Ensured that isPropertyDefined() method was used by framework instead of using 
deprecated hasProperty() method.

* Improved granular control of trace output in TracePlugin by allowing dynamic parameters

* Improved display quality and added additional data in TracePlugin
The trace plugin now displays the request event name, Mach-II version number and timestamp.

* Improved <redirect> command limitations
Allows the possibility of redirecting to another url without appending event. For example, 
<redirect url="http://www.google.com"/> would redirect to http://www.google.com?event= in 
1.1.0.  If no event name is defined, Mach-II will now not append a blank event name.

* Improved load time on initial application load or reloads by about 25%

* Added a method that returns version number of framework
Call getPropertyManager().getVersion() in any listener, filter, plugin or view to get the 
version number.  Check out the Mach-II FAQs for more information on the version numbering 
system.

* Added enhancement to turn of trace output on a per request basis.
This enhancement is important for AJAX integration. See the file header in the 
TracePlugin.cfc for more information.

* Added better ColdSpring plugin integration
Added getListenerNames(), getFilterNames() and getPluginNames() methods for even easier
ColdSpring plugin integration.

* Added an enhancement to get the event name that started the request lifecycle 
Call getRequestName() method on the event object to get the event that started the request 
lifecycle. This also works with exception events. This does not work with redirects since 
ColdFusion aborts the request before it processes the cflocation.

* Added Application.cfc support (new bootstrapper)
You can now leverage Application.cfc features such as onSessionStart/End and 
onApplicationStart/End with Mach-II. See the Mach-II FAQs for more information on 
implementing on using the new bootstrapper. This feature is only available on ColdFusion 
MX 7+. NewAltanta BlueDragon 7 is in beta at the time of this release and thus this
is an untested feature on BlueDragon.  Check out the updated Mach-II Skeleton for
working code with the new Application.cfc support.

* Lots of other small things...
